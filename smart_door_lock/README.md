# Europa Anti-Theft Engineering

### Project Overview: 

The Europa Anti-Theft Engineering Mini Project focuses on developing a Smart Lock System designed to enhance the security of homes, bedrooms, and other types of doors.
The goal of this project is to create a modern, reliable, and user-friendly system that allows homeowners to control access to their properties remotely, ensuring better safety against unauthorized access or theft.
This system would allow homeowners to lock or unlock doors remotely, track access logs, and use advanced methods of authentication.

### Key features of the system include:

Remote Access Control:
- Using a smartphone or mobile app, users can lock/unlock doors from anywhere.
- This eliminates the need for physical keys, which can be lost or stolen.

Biometric Authentication:
- The smart lock can include fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, or QR scanning as a method of unlocking the door.
- This adds a layer of personalization and makes unauthorized entry significantly more difficult.
